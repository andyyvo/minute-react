If you do a Google search with these four words – “public speaking scarier death” – you’ll get more than 50 million results, many of them about surveys noting that people list speaking in public as their No. 1 fear, with death coming in second. If you find yourself agreeing with those surveys, even reading these words may be causing your pulse to quicken or your palms to sweat (apologies for that). But here’s the good news: You can do this. We’ve broken down the art of public speaking to make it less overwhelming and potentially even rewarding. (Seriously.)",

        "From TEDxTALKS: Communication is the most important skill for personal and professional success. In this talk, Danish Dhamani discusses how overcoming your fear of public speaking is key to leading a fulfilling life and unlocking your true potential.  Danish’s vision is to empower everyone around the world to overcome their fear of public speaking and to become a better communicator. As a first generation immigrant, for whom English is a second language, the fear of public speaking haunted Danish throughout his early life. By constant practicing and coaching, he soon realized that people are not born public speakers; instead public speaking is a learn-able skill. This is what inspired Danish to create Orai, a mobile app that uses artificial intelligence to improve your speaking ability. ",
