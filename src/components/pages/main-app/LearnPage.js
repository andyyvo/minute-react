If you do a Google search with these four words – “public speaking scarier death” – you’ll get more than 50 million results, many of them about surveys noting that people list speaking in public as their No. 1 fear, with death coming in second. If you find yourself agreeing with those surveys, even reading these words may be causing your pulse to quicken or your palms to sweat (apologies for that). But here’s the good news: You can do this. We’ve broken down the art of public speaking to make it less overwhelming and potentially even rewarding. (Seriously.)",

        "From Harvard Business Review: When you get rattled while speaking — whether you’re nervous, distracted, or at a loss for what comes next — it’s easy to lean on filler words, such as “um,” “ah,” or “you know.” These words can become crutches that diminish our credibility and distract from our message. To eliminate such words from your speech, replace them with pauses. To train yourself to do this, take these three steps. First, identify your crutch words and pair them with an action. Every time you catch yourself saying “like,” for example, tap your leg. Once you’ve become aware of your filler words as they try to escape your lips, begin forcing yourself to be silent. Finally, practice more than you think you should. The optimal ratio of preparation to performance is one hour of practice for every minute of presentation. ",

There is a greater force out there — and yes, due to unforeseen circumstances — that is actually opening doors for people to become better public speakers. Sounds kind of counterintuitive, doesn't it? Conferences and conference attendance aren't what they used to be. There are no microphones, podiums or crowded audiences for speakers. There's no buzz in the hallways and no immediate feedback. But then again, there's also no tripping hazard on the way to the stage.",

        "From Inc. : Some people love public speaking. Others dread it. But absolutely no one gets excited about presenting over Zoom. Why would they? Presenting over video generally means speaking at your computer for however many minutes, anxiously wondering how your speech is going down while worrying whether your neck looks funny from the camera angle you've chosen. That hardly sounds like a blast for you or for the audience. But according to communication coach and Georgetown University professor Sarah Gershman, it doesn't have to be this way. You may never be able to bathe in the buzz of the room over Zoom, but on HBR recently Gershman said that it is possible to make presenting over video way less awkward. Here are her tips. ",

In this talk, Danish Dhamani discusses how overcoming your fear of public speaking is key to leading a fulfilling life and unlocking your true potential.  Danish’s vision is to empower everyone around the world to overcome their fear of public speaking and to become a better communicator. As a first generation immigrant, for whom English is a second language, the fear of public speaking haunted Danish throughout his early life. By constant practicing and coaching, he soon realized that people are not born public speakers; instead public speaking is a learn-able skill. This is what inspired Danish to create Orai, a mobile app that uses artificial intelligence to improve your speaking ability. ",
